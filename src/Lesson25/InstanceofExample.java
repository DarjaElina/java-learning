        // Because it's possible that a subclass of Student might implement Jumpable,

        // Student student = new Student();
        // The compiler knows that Student and Human are not related at all.
        // So the instanceof check is not allowed, it would always be false.

        // But Jumpable is an interface, and even though Student doesn't implement it directly,
        // some subclass of Student might. So the check is allowed.
